**What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of HTML5 sematic tags is to clearly state what each section of the website is. I believe the most useful one would be <main> since this will be the section where your important information you want to display.
**What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
<html> -> <head> -> <body>(Then what ever order it is written inside the body i.e. <header><main><footer>)
**What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
We learned how to use and create our own snippets. I am pretty positive I will be making my own snippets to make typing code more efficient.
**What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
Figuring out when to use certain semantic tags. I could improve by practicing making html pages using the provided semantic tags and see what happens. -->
