- Robot will run process for each person that enters elevator
- Robot request user for floor number
- User inputs floor number
- Robot will verify:
  - Does the floor request fall in the range of floors available
    - If floor is not available ask user again for input
      - Loop back to parent
    - If floor is available move on
  - If requested floor is the current floor
    - Tell User that they are on that floor
      - Loop back to parent
    - If floor is different move on
- Robot will search for requested floor number:
  - Assuming numbers start at the bottom left and goes upwards in order
  - Robot checks bottom left value
    - If value does not match up with user input move up one row
      - Continue check until last row is checked
      - If last row does not match go one column to the right, and first row
      - Repeat until floor number matches user request
      - Since floor availability check has been responded, it should not reach the final number without finding it
        - Just in case it does: if final row/column has been reach with no match, ask user to verify number and search again
  - Once number has been match
    - Press button
- Once floor has been reached
  - Ask user if this is the correct floor
    - If not repeat process
    - If correct floor move on
