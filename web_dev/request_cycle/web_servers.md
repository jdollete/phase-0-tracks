## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

   It is a virtual machine that has it's own operating system and memory hardware that can be used to host a program. The advantages of using a VPS is that you are not sharing resources with anyone else. You are defined the amount of memory and bandwidth within your virtual environment. Also if your OS crashes you could just scrap the current VM and start a new one in seconds.   

## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

   When you run programs as the root user, you are able to modify/change/delete system files. Logging in as a non-root user would prevent that and help protect against malicious or buggy applications.
